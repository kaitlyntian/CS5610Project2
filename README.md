<!-- Nathaniel's Code Review:
- The structure of your route endpoints in you index.js file is really organized. I like how you define your get routes first
and then your post routes. It makes it easier to visualize the AJAX calls from your frontend (with regards to the login, register
and feedback pages).
- There are snippets of commented code in some of your files, most of them in your mongodb.js file. May I suggest removing 
your commented code that aren't being used and adding very brief comments to the code that's being used. It helps with understanding
what your code does.
- I really love how you utilized tableau to visualize the ventures data in your report page (index.html) as well how responsive the 
data is in your report page (index.html). It would be really nice if you could explain how the tableau aspects in your web app 
work. -->
