                Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers
                to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day.
                The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be
                about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity
                to complete one of three common writing challenges. The writer
                can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and
                build upon it. A second option is to use the random paragraph
                somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to
                have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short
                story. No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the
                writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph
                into their writing.

                Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing
                routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the
                intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original
                meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing started so
                that when the writer goes onto their day's writing projects,
                words are already flowing from their fingers.

                A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to
                tackle writers' block. Writing block can often happen due to
                being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to
                complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph from which
                to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been
                causing the writers' block in the first place.

                It's not only writers who can benefit from this free online
                tool. If you're a programmer who's working on a project where
                blocks of text are needed, this tool can be a great way to get
                that. It's a good way to test your programming and that the tool
                being created is working well.
